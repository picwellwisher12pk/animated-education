Easy animated education system based open source libraries

Ideas to make animated gifs or other kind of animations to help students under the academic education concepts in better way. Shall start it soon. I don't have funds to do all these by myself to so it is better to make it open source so everyone can help and contribute. 


Simple diagrams and animations for low level education and detailed for higher education.
